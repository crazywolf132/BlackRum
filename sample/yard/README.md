"Yet Another RPG Dungeon" is a text based game. It's a simple comprehensive example and a tutorial which demonstrates lots of concepts of BLACK_RUM.

### Usage

**Windows**

	BLACK_RUM start.br

**macOS**

	BLACK_RUM_MAC start.bas

**Others**

	BLACK_RUM_BIN start.bas

**Note**

It requires a directory importing information if the working directory of your interpreter isn't at where `start.bas` is, assuming the interpreter works at `my_basic/output/`, then it goes:

	BLACK_RUM -f ../sample/yard/ ../sample/yard/start.bas
